# Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the LeetCode Premium application to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
- Your code pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure your code is committed and pushed to your Git repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: LeetCode Premium application"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"

2. **Import Your Repository**
   - Connect your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
   - Select your repository containing the LeetCode Premium code
   - Click "Import"

3. **Configure Project Settings**
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js (should be auto-detected)
   - **Root Directory**: `leetcode-premium` (if your repo has the project in a subdirectory)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (default)
   - **Output Directory**: `.next` (default)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (default)

4. **Environment Variables**
   - No environment variables are required for this basic setup
   - You can add them later if needed for features like authentication

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the build process to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### 3. Verify Deployment

Once deployed, you'll get a URL like `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

Test the following features:
- âœ… Home page loads correctly
- âœ… Problems page shows the problem list
- âœ… Individual problem pages work
- âœ… Companies page displays company cards
- âœ… Code editor loads and functions
- âœ… Responsive design works on mobile

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **Add Custom Domain**
   - Go to your project settings in Vercel
   - Navigate to "Domains" tab
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow the DNS configuration instructions

2. **SSL Certificate**
   - Vercel automatically provides SSL certificates
   - Your site will be available at both `https://your-domain.com` and `https://your-project.vercel.app`

## Performance Optimization

The application is already optimized for Vercel with:

- **Static Generation**: Most pages are statically generated
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for optimal loading
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for better performance
- **Edge Functions**: Ready for serverless functions if needed

## Monitoring and Analytics

1. **Vercel Analytics**
   - Enable Vercel Analytics in your project settings
   - Monitor page views, performance metrics, and user behavior

2. **Error Tracking**
   - Check the "Functions" tab for any runtime errors
   - Monitor build logs for deployment issues

## Updates and Maintenance

### Automatic Deployments
- Every push to your main branch triggers a new deployment
- Preview deployments are created for pull requests

### Manual Deployments
- Use `vercel --prod` command for manual deployments
- Or trigger deployments from the Vercel dashboard

### Rollbacks
- Vercel keeps deployment history
- You can rollback to any previous deployment from the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check the Functions tab for server-side errors
   - Use browser dev tools for client-side debugging

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Use Vercel Analytics to identify slow pages
   - Optimize images and code splitting
   - Consider upgrading to Vercel Pro for better performance
